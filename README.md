# Metahne-and-Carbon-Monoxide-Detection-using-LoRa-Technology
To develop a safety system for underground workers using ESP32 DevKit V1 devices, RA-02 LoRa modules, and MQ-4 and MQ-7 sensors to detect methane (CHâ‚„) and carbon monoxide (CO) gas levels. Alerts are sent to a receiver with an LCD display, buzzer, and LED for real-time monitoring and safety notifications.
